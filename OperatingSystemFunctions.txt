The Task Bar in Windows 10 is extremely useful. Depending on how you have your Windows 10 set up, normally you would start with the Windows icon 
on the very bottom left hand corner of your screen. This is basically how you navigate Windows 10 at the most basic of levels. You can view all system information, while
just to the right you can type in the search bar provided, and find any file or program saved on the device. If you are connected to the internet you can search
for files and programs online as well. Then you have the apps on your task bar that are either open or ones you have pinned. This can be helpful for multitasking or general
navigation. On the very right hand side you have your hidden icons and volume, internet connection, language and time. To the very far right you have your notification panel.

The settings in Windows 10 are fairly straight forward. There are many options to choose from, but they all describe what they lead to accurately. If you can not find what you 
are looking for, there is a search bar for your convenience. If you can not find your settings, you can either right click the Windows logo on the bottom left hand side
or type 'settings' into the search bar just right of the Windows logo. 

On the far right hand side of the task bar you will find the notification panel. This is shown as a small chat box looking icon. Here you will not only find recent notifications, but quick settings as well. You can manage your notifications and chnage settings like network, Night Light, and VPN with fewer clicks and keystrokes than it takes to get to the
main settings tab in Windows 10.
